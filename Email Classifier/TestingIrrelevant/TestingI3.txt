Program quitting after logging in 12/6/2023, 2:55:39 PM

My program quits right after logging in and scrolling for a few seconds. I thought it might be because of the code I added to make it sleep, so I re-downloaded the generate_twitter_vectoy.py file and just added my code for popular list. I had previously been able to run my program like that, but that did not work either. The only other difference is that I added a few lines of code to make it sleep for 5 minutes after 9 accounts after the for (word, count) in wc.items() loop.
