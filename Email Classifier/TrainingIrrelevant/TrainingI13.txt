Hey y'all,

My treasurer notified me that we have only received $200 from you for our November 18th tournament. As you had brought two teams, the payment was $200 for the first team and an additional $150 for the second team. Is there any way you could get us that additional $150 as soon as you can? Let me know if you have any questions. Our treasurer's venmo is Kareem-Youssif (Last 4 digits of phone number is 4038).

Thank you,
Blake Todorowski
