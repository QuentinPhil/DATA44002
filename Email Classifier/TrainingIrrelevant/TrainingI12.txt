Hi ,


I just wanted to take a minute to wish you happy holidays and thank you from the bottom of my heart.


This year has been a whirlwind, and I’m so excited to show you what else I’ve been working on (in the very near future).


I’m so grateful for your support. 


That you watch my YouTube videos, read my emails, and are a part of this incredible journey.


I enjoy spreading my love for climbing with the world, and reaching millions of people every year wouldn’t be possible without you.


Next year, I’ll share a ton of cool things with you thanks to my new brand, Altitude, and I’d love for you to be a part of it. 


If you haven’t done so already, let me know which climbing courses you’d like me to develop next, and help me make them the best that they can be.


And if you’d like to combine your passion for climbing with the non-climbing skills you have, check out our open positions.


We’re looking for a copywriter, course content editor, video editor, and more.


Check out the Altitude website to learn more, and make sure to follow us on Instagram.


I’ll see you there!


Magnus
