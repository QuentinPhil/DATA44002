Hi ,


Magnus here.


I just wanted to send you a quick heads-up that the Online Bouldering Clinic bonus for new Bouldering Blueprint members expires in a few hours.


If you want to have a chance to get coached by me…


And you want to:

Develop a solid foundation that shortens your learning curve

Get better at slabs, overhangs, roofs and dynamic boulder problems

Learn new skills like heel hooks, toe hooks, mantles, pogos and run and jumps

Improve your body positioning and footwork

Start training your fingers with safe, injury-free methods

Add more structure to your gym sessions by following my training plans

Develop climbing-specific strength that helps you do hard moves

Then join us in the course by tonight, 11:59pm US Eastern time (that’s a few hours from now).


I hope to see you inside!


Magnus
