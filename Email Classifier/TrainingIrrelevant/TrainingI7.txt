I’d like to send you 6 new wines to try!
Hi Quentin,

Now that you’re an Angel, you’re investing in world-class wines each month. You have a total of $40.00 available to put toward a few more bottles — are you ready for a new shipment?

As one of your Wine Advisors, I have a no-nonsense proposal:

Give me a chance to send you a curated 6-pack of wines that I personally recommend — and I know you’ll love!
If I get any wine wrong, I’ll refund you in full — pronto
If I get all the wines right — you’ll get a sensational 6-pack delivered to your door. I even take requests!
All you need to do is hit reply and say:

Send me wine!

…“yes please!” works just fine too. One of our expert Wine Advisors will send you a proposal for a customized 6-pack to make sure you get the perfect wines.

And if you have any specific instructions — like: “I want a pack of reds!” “Crisp whites, please!” “Can I get sparkling and Rosé thrown in?”

All ears.

Kind Wishes,
Lokelani and the Wine Advisor Team
Naked Wines

PS - Every wine comes with a personal recommendation from our all-star advisor team and is backed by a hassle-free guarantee. If you don’t like a wine, we’ll give you a credit so you can try something else. You’ve got nothing to lose — just world-class wines to drink!
