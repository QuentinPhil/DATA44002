Northwestern | Kellogg
Warmest wishes for a bright and happy holiday
As 2023 draws to a close, I am filled with excitement for the future here at Kellogg. Our faculty, students, staff and alumni have accomplished so much this year, and we look forward to welcoming new Kellogg leaders to our community. Together, we can all make an impact. May your holidays be filled with happiness and your new year filled with success.
