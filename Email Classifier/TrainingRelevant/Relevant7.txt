Hi Quentin,

Theory is good, but practice is better. Now that you’ve set your sights on finding the right business school to accelerate your career, we’re reaching out to introduce you to our challenge-based curriculum here at Hult, the first triple-accredited US business school. With our Application Deadline coming up on Wednesday, December 20, 2023, we empower our students to become the best version of themselves and grow into the resilient, self-aware, and ethical leaders the future needs.

Our degrees are designed around the universal truth that to master any skill—from riding a bike to leading a team—it must be practiced. Through an immersive, learning-by-doing experience, you’ll develop the skills most in-demand with employers worldwide that can transform your life and career. 

Whether you seek needs-based application support, merit-based recognition, or government assistance, we’re here to guide you toward the best option to start your degree.  When you start your application with us, one of our dedicated enrollment advisors will personally reach out to you to ensure the choice you make aligns with your goals and aspirations. The deadline to apply for our 2024 programs is coming up on Wednesday, December 20.
