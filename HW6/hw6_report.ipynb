        "#### The X bot I made releases information about the newest weekly release of the Jujutsu Kaisen manga online. Because posts all over the internet begin spoiling the content of the new chapters shortly after they release, it is very important for readers to remain up to date as chapters come out to avoid having the rapidly developing plot spoiled. The bot is timed to post weekly as new chapters come out with a link to the chapter and the first few sentences of that weeks blurb. It also updates automatically, so that it will post about the correct updated chapter each time. Anyone who wants a reminder about the chapter as well as easy access to it can follow this bot, and be reminded every time a new chapter is posted.\n",

        "#### The bot runs off of the scrape_twitter_v2.py file and uses pip install to download beautifulsoup, requests, and nltk.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### This twitter bot contains all of the necessary information and does not spoil the endings of each chapter. It also contains no images from the chapter that may spoil readers who are not caught up."
