
Hi Quentin,
 

Our latest class of Kellogg Leaders is doing more than just getting great jobs upon graduation — they’re breaking salary records, nabbing big signing bonuses, and changing industries. And 95% received a job offer in three months or less after graduation.  


Here are just a few of our Two-Year MBA graduates' remarkable achievements:

The median base salary was $175,000, nearly double their pre-MBA salaries. This represents a $10,000 increase from 2022, and a 35% increase since 2018.
Nearly 86% of students reported receiving a sign-on bonus; the median sign-on bonus was $30,000.
Our graduates reached an all-time high median total compensation of $207,000.
Graduates accepted positions in a wide variety of industries and functions, with consulting, financial services and technology among top destinations. 
The success in recruiting and hiring last year’s graduates for both internships and full-time positions wouldn’t have been possible without the strength of and collaboration within our network of nearly 70,000 Kellogg alumni.
