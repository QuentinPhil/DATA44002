Your classmate posted a new Question.

Confusion Matrix Format

What is the proper format of a confusion matrix? 

For example Slide 45 in Module 13 shows the format below on the left but the slide also uses Wiki as a reference which has a different format.  See below on the right.
For what it is worth sklearn's confusion_matrix() function will produce the one on the right. 

If you label all the rows and columns it may not matter
