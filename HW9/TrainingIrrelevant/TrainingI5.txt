Dear W&M Community,

 

In support of construction at Kaplan Arena, electrical power to a number of campus buildings, including residence halls, will be disrupted between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 19.

 

The work affects the main electrical loop on campus, thus disrupting multiple facilities as crews connect new electrical switch gear at Kaplan. The time has been selected so as to not impact exam periods or dining operations during the day.

 

Power is expected to be restored before 6 a.m.
