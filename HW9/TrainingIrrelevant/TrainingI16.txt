Adjusting Axis Labels in Plotly

Hello,

I am wondering if there is a way to rotate/adjust the size of x-axis labels in Plotly, specifically Parallel Coordinate Plots. The labels are currently overlapped, as seen below, and I would like to adjust them so they are not so. I have written the code for this plot based off what we completed in the Describing Data Assignment. Thank you in advance!
